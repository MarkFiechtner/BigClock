This directory contains the information I could generate on the hardware I used for this project.

Raspberry PI Zero W (there is NO dependency on this so use what you want)
32GB MicroSD card (way too big; but, I got it cheap)
SparkFun Logic Level Converter - Bi-Directional (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009)
SparkFun ATX Power Connector Breakout Kit - 12V/5V (4-pin) (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15701)
(4) 7-Segment Display - 6.5" (Red) (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8530)
(4) SparkFun Large Digit Driver (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13279)
(1) Jumper Wire - 0.1", 6-pin, 6" (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10371)
(2) Jumper Wire - 0.1", 6-pin, 12" (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10376)
Another 6-pin jumper to connect to the first digit (4", 6" or 12", depending on your need)
An Adafruit Perma-Proto (no-EEPROM)

NOTE: The PI has power supplied to the GPIO header by the 5v portion of the power supply
NOTE: The PI Zero W has on-board wifi which attaches to my home network to get the time
	(NTP) and allow headless operation while supporting an SSH command line
NOTE: You can use either the HAT or bonnet version of the perma-proto as all the other parts
	will fit either

I added some jumper wires and soldered some headers to the perma-proto HAT to create the
	proper circuits and attachments.
I use one of the 7-segment displays (minute 10's) upside down.  This allows me to blink the
	two decimal points (hour 1's, minute 10's) as a second indicator.
I used the two 12" jumpers to attach the upside down display (minute 10's) to the previous
	(hour 1's) and next (minute 1's) displays.
